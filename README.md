# Opti++
## Introduction
Opti++ is a framework optimization library fully written in C++. Current version 0.1.0.0 is a preliminary release.  
Currently there are two working methodologies available out-of-the-box: DOE Full Factorial and DOE Latin Hypercube.  
Working examples are available in folder /test.    
Both code and documentation improvments are planned in short time. Documentation is available at this <a href="https://claudeto80.github.io/Opti_plus_plus/docs/html/index.html" target="_blank"> page </a>. A more generic project's overview is available <a href="https://myprogrammingexperiencecom.wordpress.com/opensource-projects/" target="_blank"> here </a>.<br>
Please, share any feedback, requirements and issue at myprogrammingexperience@gmail.com
## Compilation
Currently only source code is released. To create project to be compiled it is possible using CMAake 3.10.0 or later.
Project creation and compilation was tested on MSWindows only with Visual Studio 2017 and MingW64 8.1.0 Maybe that compilation 
can work on other operative sistems and with other compilers. However it is required a C++ compiler which supports at least C++17 standard
